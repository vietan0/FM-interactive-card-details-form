## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Freshen React knowledge
- `maxlength` attr on `input` - no JS required!
- `e.preventDefault()` to stop button from sending `POST` request immediately
- Remember to `import` images through React, not write `<img src=...` directly
